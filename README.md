# event-camera-simulator

This is python-based simulator for an event-camera. The simulator draws visual attention on a region-level. This indicates that instead of identifying events for each pixel, the design flow labels each region based on the spatio-temporal relevance.

HOW TO RUN ?

NOTE
=================
The output images generated by the simulator can be used to train a CNN model for classification and detection task.

Please look at my other repository to see how the custom datasets can be used for training:
